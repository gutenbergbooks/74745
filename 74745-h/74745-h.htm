</div>

<h3><i>I</i></h3>

<p><i>At the moment I cannot recall the name of any other person whatever
who, at the age of twenty-three, has enjoyed so picturesque and
rambling an existence as Langston Hughes. Indeed, a complete account
of his disorderly and delightfully fantastic career would make a
fascinating picaresque romance which I hope this young Negro will
write before so much more befalls him that he may find it difficult to
capture all the salient episodes within the limits of a single volume.</i></p>

<p><i>Born on February 1, 1902, in Joplin, Missouri, he had lived, before
his twelfth year, in the City of Mexico, Topeka, Kansas, Colorado
Springs, Charlestown, Indiana, Kansas City, and Buffalo. He attended
Central High School, from which he graduated, at Cleveland, Ohio,
while in the summer, there and in Chicago, he worked as delivery- and
dummy-boy in hat-stores. In his senior year he was elected class poet
and editor of the Year Book.</i></p>

<p><i>After four years in Cleveland, he once more joined his father
in Mexico, only to migrate to New York where he entered Columbia
University. There, finding the environment distasteful, or worse, he
remained till spring, when he quit, broke with his father and, with
thirteen dollars in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>cash, went on his own. First, he worked for a
truck-farmer on Staten Island; next, he delivered flowers for Thorley;
at length he partially satisfied an insatiable craving to go to sea by
signing up with an old ship anchored in the Hudson for the winter. His
first real cruise as a sailor carried him to the Canary Islands, the
Azores, and the West Coast of Africa, of which voyage he has written:
“Oh, the sun in Dakar! Oh, the little black girls of Burutu! Oh, the
blue, blue bay of Loanda! Calabar, the city lost in a forest; the long,
shining days at sea, the masts rocking against the stars at night;
the black Kru-boy sailors, taken at Freetown, bathing on deck morning
and evening; Tom Pey and Haneo, whose dangerous job it was to dive
under the seven-ton mahogany logs floating and bobbing at the ship’s
side and fasten them to the chains of the crane; the vile houses of
rotting women at Lagos; the desolation of the Congo; Johnny Walker,
and the millions of whisky bottles buried in the sea along the West
Coast; the daily fights on board, officers, sailors, everybody drunk;
the timorous, frightened missionaries we carried as passengers; and
George, the Kentucky colored boy, dancing and singing the Blues on the
after-deck under the stars.”</i></p>

<p><i>Returning to New York with plenty of money and a monkey, he presently
shipped again—this time for Holland. Again he came back to New York and
again he sailed—on his twenty-second birthday: February 1, 1924. Three
weeks later he found himself in Paris with less than seven dollars.
However, he was soon provided for: a woman of his own race engaged him
as doorman at her <span lang="FR">boîte de nuit</span>. Later he was employed, first as second
cook, then as waiter, at the Grand Duc, where the Negro entertainer,
Florence, sang at this epoch. Here he made friends with an Italian
family <span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>who carried him off to their villa at Desenzano on Lago di
Garda where he passed a happy month, followed by a night in Verona
and a week in Venice. On his way back across Italy his passport was
stolen and he became a beach-comber in Genoa. He has described his
life there to me: “Wine and figs and pasta. And sunlight! And amusing
companions, dozens of other beach-combers roving the dockyards and
water-front streets, getting their heads whacked by the Fascisti, and
breaking one loaf of bread into so many pieces that nobody got more
than a crumb. I lived in the public gardens along the water-front and
slept in the Albergo Populare for two lire a night amidst the snores
of hundreds of other derelicts.... I painted my way home as a sailor.
It seems that I must have painted the whole ship myself. We made a
regular ‘grand tour’: Livorno, Napoli (we passed so close to Capri I
could have cried). Then all around Sicily—Catania, Messina, Palermo—the
Lipari Islands, miserable little peaks of pumice stone out in the sea;
then across to Spain, divine Spain! My buddy and I went on a spree in
Valencia for a night and a day.... Oh, the sweet wine of Valencia!”</i></p>

<p><i>He arrived in New York on November 10, 1924. That evening I attended a
dance given in Harlem by the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People. Some time during the course of the night, Walter
White asked me to meet two young Negro poets. He introduced me to
Countée Cullen and Langston Hughes. Before that moment I had never
heard of either of them.</i></p>

<h3><i>II</i></h3>

<p><i>I have merely sketched a primitive outline of a career as rich in
adventures as a fruit-cake is full of raisins. I have <span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>already
stated that I hope Langston Hughes may be persuaded to set it down
on paper in the minutest detail, for the bull-fights in Mexico, the
drunken gaiety of the Grand Duc, the delicately exquisite grace of the
little black girls at Burutu, the exotic languor of the Spanish women
at Valencia, the barbaric jazz dances of the cabarets in New York’s own
Harlem, the companionship of sailors of many races and nationalities,
all have stamped an indelible impression on the highly sensitized,
poetic imagination of this young Negro, an impression which has found
its initial expression in the poems assembled in this book.</i></p>

<p><i>And also herein may be discerned that nostalgia for color and warmth
and beauty which explains this boy’s nomadic instincts.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span><i>More of this wistful longing may be discovered in the poems
entitled</i> The South <i>and</i> As I Grew Older. <i>His verses, however,
are by no means limited to an exclusive mood; he writes
caressingly of little black prostitutes in Harlem; his cabaret
songs throb with the true jazz rhythm; his sea-pieces ache
with a calm, melancholy lyricism; he cries bitterly from the
heart of his race in</i> Cross <i>and</i> The Jester; <i>he sighs, in one of
the most successful of his fragile poems, over the loss of a
loved friend. Always, however, his stanzas are subjective,
personal. They are the (I had almost said informal, for
they have a highly deceptive air of spontaneous improvisation)
expression of an essentially sensitive and subtly illusive
nature, seeking always to break through the veil that obscures
for him, at least in some degree, the ultimate needs of that
nature.</i></p>

<p><i>To the Negro race in America, since the day when Phillis
Wheatley indited lines to General George Washington and
other aristocratic figures (for Phillis Wheatley never sang
“My way’s cloudy,” or “By an by, I’m goin to lay down
dis heavy load”) there have been born many poets. Paul
Laurence Dunbar, James Weldon Johnson, Claude McKay,
Jean Toomer, Georgia Douglas Johnson, Countée Cullen,
are a few of the more memorable names. Not the least of
these names, I think, is that of Langston Hughes, and perhaps
his adventures and personality offer the promise of as
rich a fulfillment as has been the lot of any of the others.</i></p>
